   * Merge sort takes advantage of the ease of merging already sorted lists into a new sorted list.
   * It starts by comparing every two elements (i.e., 1 with 2, then 3 with 4...) and swapping them
   * if the first should come after the second. It then merges each of the resulting lists of two
   * into lists of four, then merges those lists of four, and so on; until at last two lists are
   * merged into the final sorted list. Of the algorithms described here, this is the first that
   * scales well to very large lists, because its worst-case running time is O(n log n). It is also
   * easily applied to lists, not only arrays, as it only requires sequential access, not random
   * access. However, it has additional O(n) space complexity, and involves a large number of
   * copies in simple implementations.
